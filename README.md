# SpectreCss

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/spectre_css`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spectre_css'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install spectre_css

Import Spectre.css styles in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:
```css
 *= require spectre.css
```
or you can add one or all of
```css
 *= require spectre.min.css
 *= require spectre-exp.css
 *= require spectre-exp.min.css
```
Icons
```css
 *= require spectre-icons.css
 *= require spectre-icons.min.css
```
## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
